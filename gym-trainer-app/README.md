# Gymble 🏋️‍♂️

**Gymble** is a trainer-first web app for managing gym clients, workouts, and live training sessions.

The goal is to replace messy Excel sheets and WhatsApp messages with a clean, simple tool that helps personal trainers:
- Create and assign tailored workouts
- Show exercise videos and instructions
- Track client progress over time
- Handle multiple clients at once in a live session

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router, TypeScript)
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Supabase** (planned) for auth & database
- Deployed on **Vercel** (planned)

## Current Status

Early MVP / WIP:
- ✅ Base Next.js app created
- ✅ Repo initialized on GitHub
- ⏳ Trainer dashboard UI
- ⏳ Client "Today’s Workout" page
- ⏳ Supabase integration (auth + DB)
